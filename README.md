# ChessJava

Chess Application in Java

Before using XCode (installed from the Apple Mac App Store), I had to read and agree to the XCode License agreement: `sudo xcodebuild -license`

Afterwards, I was able to clone this ChessJava repo to my local Mac directory:
`git clone https://github.com/a-rcrawford/ChessJava.git ~/src/chess/java/`
